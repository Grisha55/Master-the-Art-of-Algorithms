# Key DP Concepts Illustrated:
- Overlapping Subproblems: Fibonacci shows repeated calculations (fib(3) called multiple times)
- Optimal Substructure: Knapsack's solution builds on smaller subproblems
- State Transition: Coin Change demonstrates how to transition between states
- Space-Time Tradeoff: All problems show optimization paths
- Each solution progresses from intuitive to optimized versions, demonstrating core DP principles.


### This directory includes:
1. Four classic DP problems with Swift implementations
2. Multiple approaches for each problem (naive â†’ optimized)
3. Clear English explanations
4. Time/Space complexity analysis
5. Example test cases
6. Emphasis on fundamental DP concepts

#### The code follows Swift conventions!
