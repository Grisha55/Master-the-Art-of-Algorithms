## 📚 List of Implemented Algorithms

| #  | Algorithm Name     | Description                              |
|----|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0  | **Insertion Sort** | Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. |
| 1  | **Selection Sort** | Selects the smallest element and moves it to the front. |
| 2  | **Bubble Sort**    | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. |
| 3  | **Quick Sort**     | Uses divide-and-conquer to sort efficiently. |
| 4  | **Merge Sort**     | Divides the array and merges sorted halves. |
| 5  | **Max Heap Sort**  | Builds a max-heap and extracts maximums to sort. |
| 6  | **Min Heap Sort**  | Builds a min-heap and extracts minimums to sort. |
| 7  | **Counting Sort**  | Uses a counting array to sort integers. |
| 8  | **Shell Sort**     | Generalization of insertion sort with gaps. |
| 9  | **Radix Sort**     | Sorts integers by processing individual digits. |
| 10 | **Bucket Sort**    | Distributes elements into buckets and sorts each bucket. |
